My name is Tamires, many believe that I like to be called Thammy/Tammy, because my old emails always start with a thammy/tammyxavier, but I only like to be called Tamires, sorry guys for the mistake kkkkkkkk, I'm 25 years, I am from São José dos Campos, in the interior of São Paulo, but nowadays I live in Sertânia, in the interior of Pernambuco. I started in the world of technology when I was 12/13 years old, through computer science and other related subjects that I took during my elementary school at the school where I studied full time in my hometown. Despite that, and I went after a course outside that was more comprehensive in informatics, which was always on Saturday mornings. At the age of 14, already living in Sertânia, I became interested in doing high school at a technical school, where they offered/offer an integrated technical course in computer networks, since then, I haven't stopped, I started to have contact with programming at the age of 20, and in that, I can see the other side of the universe, which by the way is fantastic, and with that, I really managed to realize that I'm on the right path, I really like learning new things/languages ​​(My curiosity doesn't let me do different) and I hope to continue like that for quite some time.
